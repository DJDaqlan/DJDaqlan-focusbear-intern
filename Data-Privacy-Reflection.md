**What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?**
In daily tasks, I can ensure that data is handled securely by managing data on one device (single-point of failure) so that there are minimal entry points. Additionally, I can ensure that when the device is not in use (such as when taking movement breaks) I can lock or log myself out of the device, ensuring that I am the only one that has access to the information. If there is the scenario where I may be biased as a result of accessing the information, I can communicate to other team members (with the appropriate authorisation) to anonymise the data for me so that I have no knowledge of the confidential information.


**How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?**
Because I own a local device, the way that I handle sensitive information would be to ensure all the information is stored behind a private user with a password. In the case that someone knows the password to my laptop, I can further ensure data security by anonymising all the data being used by processing all information so all information is confidential. 
When sharing sensitive information, I will process the information so that I remove all identifiable information, such as the user's name or ID, and use only information that is relevant to my task.
To dispose of sensitive information, I will ensure that all of the sensitive information is permanently deleted.

**What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?**
One common mistake that can lead to data privacy issues is weak security, such as poor password strength or software that has not yet been updated. This can lead to an unauthorised user using well-known software attacks to access sensitive information. This can be updated by incorporating complex passwords and ensuring that the software o hardware is updated to the most recent version.
Another common mistake that can lead to data privacy issues is social engineering, which is where people are manipulated into providing sensitive information. This can be avoided by remaining vigilant and sharing any suspicious communication to all team members so that they understand and can avoid similar attempted breaches.

*Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.*
One habit or practice that I can adopt is to anonymise the data that I use. Since I will need to use the information and process the information for use in machine learning, I can remove any information that won't be relevant or is sensitive.

*Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.*
One key security measure I will implement is to implement more complex passwords into accessing the data, which adds an extra layer of security to the sensitive data. 
Additionally, I can implement a suggestion to share any potential social engineering exploits with the other team members.
