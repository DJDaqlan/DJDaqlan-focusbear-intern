**Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?**
One instance where I experienced great teamwork was during uni, when I was in a group as part of a student association. One key aspect that led to the great teamwork was that the meeting agenda was kept organised, the meeting followed directly to the agenda so all members knew what part was being discussed and the time was allocated enough so that there would be time available to ask questions or clarification.

**What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?**
One obvious point to ensure my communication is appropriate and professional is to always use my manners and respect the chain of leadership, as well as being patient as to hear all opinions and reach a decision that is agreeable amongst all relevent team members.

It is also important to remember that my opinions are valid and meaningful, and I should not be scared or ashamed to voide my opinion; I am in this position because I earned it and I am considered an expert within Focus Bear.

**How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?**
It's important to always be optimistic but serious, where I should always take criticisms seriously but always remember that the feedback is not a reflection on myself but is something that I can work on and improve for next time. Additionally, I should be able to "read the room" and be able to change between being serious and less serious behaviour.

**How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?**
When preparing for meetings, it is important that I understand all the relevant information, which may include my progress, or details on a specific aspect of either my own work or a colleagues work. Additionally, it is important to come prepared with questions as a way to gain clarity or provide hindsight on a particular topic of interest.

**What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?**
Being proactive during my internship means that I have to treat it as a real, full time job. This means that I have to communicate effectively and efficiently, as well as being punctual and always ask questions. To me, this is a new environment and it's important to learn as much as I can within the limited time frame.

**How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?**
Firstly it is important to remember that everyone has their own role within Focus Bear and they may have different work loads than I do. In saying that, it is important that regardless of the importance of the work, I must maintain a level of professionality and not explode at them. I can initiate the follow-up with them via email and bring it up when I see them next in-person. Based on their response, I can give them around a week to complete the work and if there is still no action, I can remind them again. My approach is to refer to any higher-ups as a last resort.

**What are some things you won't do?**
It is important to never lash out and always act within a professional manner. In saying so, it's important to always show respect when the individual is and isn't around. This means to always stand up for them and don't allow other people to disrespect colleagues.
