**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**
Kanban helps manage priorities by organising all the tasks into observable columns so I can manage and prioritise all my tasks for a given sprint/time frame. It helps avoid overload because other developers or I can see what my tasks are, what my bottlenecks are and can provide assistance to alleviate said bottleneck.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**
By assigning different priorities to the tasks, I can easily organise my tasks based on size, priority or user stories, as well as other developers knowing what my current workflow is so that they can provide assistance wherever possible. Additionally, I would be able to identify any dependencies or bottlenecks in the tasks, and prioritise those tasks first.

I could potentially syncronise the Kanban with my repo to quickly identify any issues that arise, and updates the jira tickets as soon as the issue is resolved.
