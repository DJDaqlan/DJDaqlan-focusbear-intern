**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**
There are a few rules that I already follow. Some of which include:
- Always close anything I'm not using, which reduces the chances that someone will use my devices without my permission
- Never communicate with strangers online, always make sure I know their name and know why/how I know them
- If anything seems suspicious, or seems as though it is a suspicious method of communication, I will check anything related to the address or information about the sender
In terms of where I can improve, I can do the following:
- Keep a physical back-up of my work but not of the data, just in case of a security breach
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) on all my devices, ensuring that there is an additional layer of security.

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**
You can make a secure behaviour a habit by a few things, namely:
- Research the benefits of the behaviour
- Always hold yourself accountable for the behaviour and its consequences
- Set a list of instructions on what to do when encountering different scenarios

**What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**
Not necessarily steps, but there are a few things I can do to ensure my passwords and accounts are secure.
1. Regularly change my passwords. This is to ensure that if there has been a security breach that I don't/may not know of, I ensure the security of my accounts
2. Make my passwords complex. Since many penetration attacks are automated, it is quite easy for an unauthorised user to access accounts and discover my passwords. By making my passwords as complex as possible, it will take longer to access my password and gain unauthorised access.
3. Have multiple passwords. Rather than having one generic password for all accounts, I can have multiple passwords for multiple websites, especially for Focus Bear.

**What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**
If there was a suspected security breach or suspicious activity on my account, I will first not communicate any further with the source, in case there are any opportunities that the hacker may access my information from any of my inputs. Then I would ask around and gauge if anyone else has been affected, either through someone impersonating me or by a similar attack. Afterwards I will share the suspected security breach or suspicious activity to spread awareness.
