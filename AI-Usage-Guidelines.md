**When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**
AI should be used for assistance when you need help with small trivial tasks that you already know how to do, or when you need ideas to bounce off and gain understanding about your work. You should rely on your own skills when gaining inspiration and planning various aspects of the solution and its code.

**How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**
One key point to avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefitting from it by using it not as an assistant that does everything for you, but as a teacher and a consultant that can help you learn and discuss various topics with you.

**What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**
One key step to ensure data privacy is to anonymise and atomise the information as much as I can, while keeping the tasks for AI as simple and general as I need to be. For example if I needed to figure out how to efficiently process a user's information and habits, I wouldn't give them the entire database and ask them to filter the information, I would instead ask them to "filter a group of information into something more manageable" or something along those lines, so that I can apply the same algorithm to the entire database.
Additionally, after each conversation with the AI, even though it may not do much, but I can ask it to clear all chat history, and delete the conversation itself.
