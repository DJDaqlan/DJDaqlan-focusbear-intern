**What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?**
The biggest benefits of Agile is that it is more focused on completing the delivery of the product rather than the documentation of the product. This is the most important because a lot of programs are different and rely less on the documentation being replicable and more on the product being released as soon as possible. Additionally, Agile allows the developers to roll-back to a previous version and make any changes that they did not encounter before.

The biggest challenge of Agile is that the documentation is not as thorough as other methologies, where the waterfall method is more coherent and explicit in its requirements, Agile can be too fluid to the point where the client may completely change the project, resulting in the developer's work being made redundant.

**How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?**
Agile principles can help improve my role and responsibilities because it allows me to communicate with the client throughout development and make changes whenever they want rather than deciding on a plan at the start that may not align with the client's interests further down the product's development.

*Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.*
On one hand, Scrum is used in spaces that require more communication than autonomy, with the Scrum deliverables being used to organise meetings and ensure that all team members are kept up to date. On the other hand, Kanban uses a lot more autonomy and is especially beneficial if the various components of the product do not need to communicate with each other.

*Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.*
One Agile principle that will be the most useful is close collaboration, as the collaboration between the proposed neural network and the app will be incredibly necessary for both aspects to improve.
