**Why do you think Focus Bear was created?**
FOcus Bear was created to combat the difficulties of ADHD and ASD students with navigating around their educational life, in high school and univeristy, and make sure that they can cope with their studies.

**What problem is Focus Bear solving?**
Focus Bear is trying to solve the hyperactivity of ADHD students and the problem of ASD students when it comes to change and the overstimulation of new environments that may overwhelm them to the point where they aren't able to focus on their work.

**Why do you think this mission is important?**
This mission is important because there is an increasing population of individuals who are being diagnosed with ADHD or ASD, or are displaying ADHD/ASD symptoms, meaning that they are receiving unequal treatment when it comes to their studies.

**How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?**
Focus Bear's work aligns with my personal values and interests because I have always wanted to help reduce the education inequality between students and provide that assistance to students who need it the most. Work quote that I really stick with is "if I can't change the world of today, I can always change the world of tomorrow", and to do that, I want to be able to help the students so that they can change the world.

**Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?**
I personally relate to the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve because I always struggle with staying focused with my work; to the point where if I am distracted and have to work on something else, it becomes extremely hard to return to my work and achieve a work flow state. I think FOcus Bear will help me return to my work efficiently and effectively.
