**What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**
My role, in relation to the Agile process is the developer, which contributes by producing the deliverables that the Project Manager and stakeholders look out for.

**How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**
Since I am required to also use Focus Bear, I could be considered as a stakeholder myself as I would be regularly using the app and providing feedback to the Product Owner. This could be biased however, as since I am both a developer and a client, I might be developing the program to my own interests rather than the interests of the representative targeted audience.

*Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.*
A developer is important to the Agile team, because it serves as the backbone of the Agile metholodogy. Without a group of developers, the product won't be completed. The developers also aren't allwoed to develop the product blindly without direction; they are required to develop the program so that it meets the functional and non-functional requirements of the program outlined by the Product Owner, and by extension the stakeholders.

*Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.*
Another role that I may frequently collaborate with is the Product Owner and Agile Project Manager, to ensure that the programme being developed is to their satisfaction and I can gain feedback on improving the program.
