**What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**
Whilst other apps are focused on one key aspect in productivity and is targeted towards neurotypical individuals, Focus Bear encapsulates all of the apps, and is instead targeted towards neurodivergent individuals. Additionally, Focus Bear acknowledges that websites can be both detrimental to people's productivity, but they are also what is necessary for their productivity.

**If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**
I would choose Focus bear over competitors because over time, Focus Bear adapts and adjusts its restriction software to my own needs, whereas other apps put a hard restriction on the websites it determines as a "productivity killer".

**What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**
One feature that other apps have is its seclusivity, where all other apps are focused around one aspect of productivity, whereas Focus bear is trying to achieve all aspects of productivity.

**Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**
For Focus Bear, we could probably focus on one aspect of productivity. It could explain why a lot of users tend to leave Focus Bear early-on; because all of the tools made available to them may be excessive and they can't figure out how to improve their productivity. 
Another option we could do is to separate the todo-list and focus sessions, since the todo-list spans across the entire day, whereas the focus sessions are only focused around one 30-minute block; the timings of the different aspects of Focus Bear are disproportionate.
