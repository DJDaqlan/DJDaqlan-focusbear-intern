Behavioural changes that can improve posture and reduce strain would to take frequent breaks to reduce the pressure on my spine, and to adjust the screen height so that it matches my eye-level.

While using Focus bear to schedule movement breaks is beneficial, I can also set rules to take movement breaks after certain criteria. For example, I can set a rule that forces me to take a movement break after completing 2 tasks, or any set number of tasks.
